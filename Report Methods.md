Determining the best location to open a vegan restaurant in Toronto based on K-Means clustering

Intro:

The vegan food industry has been on a steady rise for many years now, and is increasingly becoming a viable expansion for established businesses, as seen by recent vegan additions to the menu at chains such as KFC and McDonald's. The business in question here would like to expand their business by trialling a new vegan chain of their existing franchise, located in Toronto. For this they need to determine which location (specific to the postal code) is most likely to guarantee economic success.

Data & Methods:

In order to identify the optimal location for the business to open their new vegan chain, data from Foursquare will be gathered on all vegan/vegetarian restaurants and collected into the individual postal codes. The viable location will be determined by finding the ratings of all current vegan restaurants, and identifying areas with a high density of popular restaurants where success is more likely.
Data can be scraped from sites such as Wikipedia on the co-ordinate locations of each Postal Code, and by performing a search on Foursquare for each Postal Code via the Foursquare API it will be possible to identify all vegan/vegetarian restaurants and their ratings for each respective Postal Code.
