Determining the best location to open a vegan restaurant in Toronto based on K-Means clustering

Intro:

The vegan food industry has been on a steady rise for many years now, and is increasingly becoming a viable expansion for established businesses, as seen by recent vegan additions to the menu at chains such as KFC and McDonald's. The business in question here would like to expand their business by trialling a new vegan chain of their existing franchise, located in Toronto. For this they need to determine which location (specific to the postal code) is most likely to guarantee economic success.
